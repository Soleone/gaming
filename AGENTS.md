# gaming

Gaming is a personal video-game release calendar with hype ratings and played reviews. It uses React, TypeScript, a JSON collection, and a loopback-only development editor; production is read-only. See [maintenance](docs/maintenance.md), [seed sources](docs/assets.md), and [product context](PRODUCT.md).

## Where things are

- [spec/](spec/README.md) says what the app does, as rule tables. Read it before changing behavior.
- docs/ holds anything else worth keeping: decisions, evidence, research. Create it when needed.
- `.kit.json` records which kit template and revision this project was made from. Run `kit upgrade` to see what changed in the kit since.

## Spec

Behavior is written as rules in tables with a stable slug, `area.behavior`. Tests start their title with the slug (`test("capture.open: ...")`), so `rg capture.open` finds the rule, the test and usually the code. When behavior changes, change its rule and the test that cites it together. The spec describes the target app; it doesn't authorize building all of it at once. Evidence, status and counts never go in the spec.

## Principles

- **Build the smallest real slice.** Straightforward modules and concrete code first. Add abstractions, caches or performance machinery when real use and measurement justify them.
- **Make clean cuts.** One current model, not versioned code paths. Never add version-named files, identifiers, flags or env vars (`v2`, `new`, `legacy`); name things by responsibility.
- **Keep the UI calm.** Minimal and sleek is the baseline, not a later polish step. Show the main thing, disclose details on demand.

## UI

- **Default to shadcn wherever it fits**, including cards, empty states, alerts, and other display patterns, not just interactive controls. Check for an existing component before writing custom markup. Use semantic HTML/Tailwind for page layout and custom UI only where no suitable shadcn pattern exists. Preserve the classic @soleone theme picker.
- shadcn on Base UI (`base-nova`). App code uses the components in `src/components/ui`; direct `@base-ui/react` imports are lint errors.
- `src/components/ui` and `src/components/soleone` are vendored and stay byte-for-byte upstream so they can be updated with `pnpm dlx shadcn add <item> --overwrite`. Don't edit them. `kit check` fails when they drift.
- Style through tokens and component props, never raw colors, arbitrary values or className overrides on primitives. The lint rules in `vite.config.ts` enforce this.
- Need a look the stock variants don't have? Wrap the primitive in `src/components/variants/` (e.g. `ToolbarButton` around `Button`) and use the wrapper. A plain class map plus `cn()` covers one state or one small set of kinds; reach for `cva` when a wrapper has several variant axes or compound variants, or exports its classes for use without the component. That folder is the only place allowed to restyle primitives or import `class-variance-authority`.
- Themes come from `@soleone/theme`. `src/theme/config.ts` holds this app's default theme and storage key. Components use tokens only, so every theme works without knowing about them.
- Shared components belong in the registry (Soleone/shadcn-components), not copied between apps.

## Before you finish

Run `vp check` and `kit check` and fix every error. `kit check` includes knip: an unused file, export or dependency is a finding. Delete it rather than ignore it.

<!--VITE PLUS START-->

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a `vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the project defines a script or task with that name.

## Tool Versions

Run `vp toolchain` to show versions and relationships in the active Vite+
release. Add a tool name to select part of the graph. For example, run
`vp toolchain vite`. Use `--global` to ignore the local `vite-plus` package. Use
`vp why <package>` to show the package-manager dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.
